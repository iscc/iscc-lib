# Decision Records

Append-only log of judgment calls that a future reader could not reconstruct from the code alone:
deviations from the iscc-core reference or a spec, design trade-offs between real alternatives,
accepted performance regressions, justified suppressions, API-shape choices. Written by the review
agent when approving such a call; human entries welcome. Never rewrite or delete entries — the
history is the point. Distinct from learnings.md: learnings capture operational gotchas, decisions
capture design rationale.

## 2026-07-24 — Audit role triggered by iteration cadence, not IDLE

**Decision:** The codebase audit role runs after every 10th completed iteration (plus on demand via
`mise run cid:audit`), rather than on IDLE like meta-improve or on a calendar. **Why:** Debt
accumulates fastest during busy development phases — exactly when IDLE never fires. A counter from
iterations.jsonl survives restarts and needs no clock. Findings land in issues.md right before the
next define-next, so the loop consumes them immediately. **Alternatives:** IDLE-coupling (audits
would pause during the phases that create the debt); manual-only (relies on human discipline, which
decays over months); every 5 iterations (more cost, re-finds issues the loop has not yet had time to
fix). **Context:** Interactive session with Titusz, 2026-07-24; implemented alongside this file.

## 2026-07-24 — Audit is find-and-file only, runner-enforced

**Decision:** The audit role may only change issues.md and its own agent memory; the trusted runner
(`enforce_audit_safety` in tools/cid.py) reverts anything else. Fixes flow through the normal
define-next → advance → review cycle. The audit orchestrates a parallel finder/adversarial-verify
workflow rather than using the generic high-stakes harness. **Why:** Free-form "refactoring
sessions" are where agentic projects introduce regressions — refactoring without a gate is churn.
Audit finds, the gated loop fixes. Adversarial verification (2-of-3 skeptics) keeps false positives
from steering iterations. The high-stakes skill defends a single deliverable; the audit needs
multi-dimension discovery — a different harness shape. **Alternatives:** Letting the audit fix
directly (bypasses the review gate); high-stakes skill per audit (rigor lands in the wrong place,
higher cost). **Context:** Interactive session with Titusz, 2026-07-24.

## 2026-07-24 — Scope-cap escape valve: 8 files, only for audit-cited steps

**Decision:** define-next may scope up to 8 non-test, non-doc files (instead of 3) only when the
step cites an `[audit]`-tagged issue; the review agent verifies the citation and fails the step
otherwise. **Why:** The 3-file cap systematically selects against structural fixes — the fix for an
abstraction is always bigger than a point patch, so cross-cutting cleanups (e.g. across the 8
binding crates) were unpickable by design. A hard ceiling keeps refactor steps reviewable in one
sitting. **Alternatives:** No exception (structural debt stays unpickable); uncapped audit steps
(loses the mechanical tripwire that kept 120 iterations reviewable); pre-decomposing every refactor
into 3-file steps (many refactors cannot be split while keeping every intermediate tree green).
**Context:** Interactive session with Titusz, 2026-07-24.

## 2026-07-24 — Tightening decode input-validation is not a SemVer break

**Decision:** Adding the `tail.len() > nbytes` "too long" rejection to the Tier 1,
stability-committed `iscc_decode` (and, iter 120, Go `IsccDecode`) is classified as a robustness bug
fix, not an API break — no `**API-BREAK:**` flag required, and it need not wait for the v1.0.0 cut.
**Why:** The signature and return-tuple shape are unchanged; only the set of *accepted* inputs
shrinks, and every input newly rejected was already malformed (trailing base32 chars that silently
aliased a canonical code, e.g. `ISCC:...AB` == `ISCC:...ABAA`). Narrowing the accepted domain to
reject previously- mis-decoded garbage is a correctness fix, and every conformance vector still
round-trips. **Alternatives:** Treat as breaking and defer to v1.0.0 (would leave a codec-wide
aliasing bug live across all 11 bindings for months, for no user benefit); keep truncating silently
(data-integrity hazard — two distinct strings decode identically). Note for the eventual
`cargo-semver-checks` enforcing gate: input-domain narrowing is invisible to signature-based semver
tooling, so this call is a human judgment, not a tool result. **Context:** iter 121, commit 044d0cc
(Rust); iter 120 (Go).

## 2026-07-25 — `astral-sh/setup-uv` pinned to the exact tag `@v9.0.0`

**Decision:** Every other GitHub Action in `ci.yml` / `docs.yml` is pinned to a floating major
(`@v7`, `@v5`, …), but `astral-sh/setup-uv` is pinned to the exact release tag `@v9.0.0`, with a
two-line YAML comment above each of the two occurrences explaining why. **Why:** upstream stopped
publishing floating major tags after `v7` — `git/matching-refs/tags/v` lists v1–v7 plus exact
v8.x/v9.0.0 tags only, and setup-uv's own README pins exact refs. `@v9` does not resolve; CI proved
it (`Unable to resolve action astral-sh/setup-uv@v9` on commit ebac57f). The accepted cost is that
setup-uv patch releases are no longer picked up automatically, so this pin must be bumped by hand in
each dependency-refresh pass (it recurs in `release.yml`). **Alternatives:** stay on `@v4` (leaves
the action 5 majors and a node runtime behind, defeating the refresh); pin to `@v7` to keep a
floating tag (freezes on an EOL major purely for convention); pin to a commit SHA (inconsistent with
the other 15 refs in these files, and next.md explicitly excluded SHA pinning). **Context:** iter
127, commits ebac57f → 8f76d48; deviation from next.md's `@v9` recommendation.

## 2026-07-25 — JVM manifest refresh accepted despite the raised Kotlin consumer floor

**Decision:** The iter-128 JVM dependency refresh (11 pins across `pom.xml` and `build.gradle.kts`)
was approved and pushed to `develop` even though the `kotlin("jvm")` 2.1.10 → 2.4.10 bump verifiably
breaks consumers compiling with Kotlin < 2.3 (published metadata `mv=[2,4,0]`; 2.1.10 and 2.2.21
fail, 2.3.21 passes). The support-floor question was split out as a `normal` `[review]` issue with
HUMAN REVIEW REQUESTED instead of blocking the slice. **Why:** the break cannot reach a user from
`develop` — `io.iscc:iscc-lib-kotlin` only ships via the human-dispatched `release.yml`, so there is
a natural gate before harm, and pushing lets the 41-job CI validate the other 10 pins (the real gate
for this slice). Choosing the floor is a support-policy decision of the same class as MSRV and
`java-version: '17'`, which the step's own scope explicitly reserved for the owner; a
reviewer-forced revert would have made that choice by default. **Alternatives:** NEEDS_WORK + revert
the Kotlin line to 2.1.x (silently picks "preserve the old floor" without the owner, and denies the
other pins their CI validation); pin `compilerOptions.languageVersion` to 2.1 (insufficient — the
transitive `kotlin-stdlib:2.4.10` in the published POM raises the same error on its own); HUMAN
REVIEW REQUESTED on the handoff to pause the runner (disproportionate — the loop still has
actionable refresh slices, and the issue carries the escalation). **Context:** iter 128, commit
be0a497; found independently by this review and by the Codex second opinion, then confirmed
empirically against consumer projects on Kotlin 2.1.10 / 2.2.21 / 2.3.21.
