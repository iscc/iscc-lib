## 2026-03-01 — Review of: Export META_TRIM_META in Node.js, WASM, and C FFI bindings

**Verdict:** PASS

**Summary:** Clean, mechanical, well-scoped change. `META_TRIM_META = 128_000` is now correctly
exported in all three Rust-based binding crates (Node.js/napi, WASM/wasm-bindgen, C FFI), following
the exact pattern of the existing `META_TRIM_DESCRIPTION` export. Tests and clippy pass for all
three crates, and all 14 pre-commit hooks pass.

**Verification:**

- [x] `cargo test -p iscc-napi` compiles clean — 0 Rust-side tests (expected; JS tests run in CI
    after `napi build`)
- [x] `cargo test -p iscc-wasm` compiles clean — wasm_bindgen_tests require wasm-pack runtime
    (CI-verified)
- [x] `cargo test -p iscc-ffi` passes — 78 tests (77 existing + 1 new `test_meta_trim_meta`)
- [x] `cargo clippy -p iscc-napi -- -D warnings` — clean
- [x] `cargo clippy -p iscc-wasm -- -D warnings` — clean
- [x] `cargo clippy -p iscc-ffi -- -D warnings` — clean
- [x] `mise run check` — all 14 pre-commit hooks passed

**Issues found:**

- Minor: FFI crate docstring said "4 algorithm constants" but now has 5. Fixed directly (step 9).

**Codex review:** Codex flagged `index.js` and `index.d.ts` missing `META_TRIM_META` as P0. This is
a false positive — both files are gitignored (`crates/iscc-napi/.gitignore` lists `index.js`,
`index.d.ts`) and are auto-generated by `napi build` in CI before tests run. The Rust source is
correct and CI will regenerate these files. Codex's sandbox also hit the known cross-device link
error when trying `cargo test`, which is not a code issue.

**Next:** Export `META_TRIM_META` in the remaining 2 binding crates: Java (JNI) and Go. Java needs a
`public static final int META_TRIM_META = 128000;` constant in `IsccLib.java` + test assertion
(follow `META_TRIM_DESCRIPTION` pattern). Go needs a `MetaTrimMeta = 128_000` constant in `codec.go`
(follow `MetaTrimDescription` pattern). After these 2, issue #18 is fully complete.

**Notes:** Issue #18 is now 4/5 tasks done (Rust core ✅, validation ✅, Python ✅, Node.js/WASM/C FFI
✅). Only Java and Go remain. The Java + Go step is the final binding propagation — after it, focus
shifts to issue #15 (`gen_sum_code_v0`). Java constant is a pure-Java `public static final int` (no
JNI call needed for a constant). Go constant is a `const` declaration in `codec.go`.
