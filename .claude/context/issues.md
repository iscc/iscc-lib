# Issues

Tracked issues for the CID workflow. Priorities: `critical` (next iteration), `normal` (weighed
against gaps), `low` (when nothing else remains). Source tags: `[human]`, `[review]`. Optional
fields: `**Spec:**` (spec gap link), `**Upstream:**` (external repo). The review agent deletes
resolved issues after verification (history in git).
