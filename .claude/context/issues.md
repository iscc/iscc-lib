# Issues

Tracked issues for the CID workflow. Priorities: `critical` (next iteration), `normal` (weighed
against gaps), `low` (human-directed only — CID loop must skip these). Source tags: `[human]`,
`[review]`. Optional fields: `**Spec:**` (spec gap link), `**Upstream:**` (external repo). The
review agent deletes resolved issues after verification (history in git).

## Release core as v1.0.0 (stability commitment) `low` [human]

Human-driven release: cut **v1.0.0** as the first stability-committed release of the lockstep
workspace (per the 1.0.0 decision). This is the one release allowed to break the 0.4.0 API freely;
afterward 1.x is locked under strict SemVer. Drive via the `/release` skill — do NOT let the CID
loop cut this release autonomously. Ideally land both the `cargo-semver-checks` and `iai-callgrind`
gate issues above first so 1.0.0 ships with enforcement active.

**Status (2026-06-18):** Titusz decided to **hold** the v1.0.0 cut and stay on 0.4.x for now — land
the CRAP `--fail-above` and `cargo deny` hardening gates first, then flip the `cargo-semver-checks`
gate to enforcing as part of the eventual cut. Remains `low` `[human]`; CID must not cut it
autonomously.

**Spec:** `.claude/context/specs/rust-core.md` → "API Stability & Performance Invariants"

## Add programming language logos to docs site `low` [human]

README language logos added (iteration 3). Consider adding matching logos to `docs/index.md` and
howto guide headers on the documentation site for visual consistency. Purely cosmetic follow-up.
