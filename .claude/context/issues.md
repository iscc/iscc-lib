# Issues

Tracked issues for the CID workflow. Priorities: `critical` (next iteration), `normal` (weighed
against gaps), `low` (human-directed only — CID loop must skip these). Source tags: `[human]`,
`[review]`. Optional fields: `**Spec:**` (spec gap link), `**Upstream:**` (external repo). The
review agent deletes resolved issues after verification (history in git).

## Add vcpkg.json and conanfile.py to version sync script `low` [review]

The `scripts/version_sync.py` does not check `packages/cpp/vcpkg.json` or
`packages/cpp/conanfile.py` for version consistency. Both files hardcode `"0.2.0"` and will go stale
on the next version bump. Add them to the version sync targets.

## Implement Swift bindings via UniFFI `low` [human]

Add Swift bindings as a Swift Package in `packages/swift/` using UniFFI-generated code. Requires a
shared UniFFI scaffolding crate (`crates/iscc-uniffi/`) that also serves Kotlin bindings.

**Implementation scope:**

1. **UniFFI crate** (`crates/iscc-uniffi/`):

    - `Cargo.toml` (cdylib, depends on `iscc-lib` + `uniffi`)
    - `src/lib.rs` — UniFFI interface definition (proc macros or UDL) exposing all 32 Tier 1 symbols
    - `uniffi.toml` — binding generation config

2. **Swift package** (`packages/swift/`):

    - `Package.swift` — SPM manifest
    - Generated Swift bindings via `uniffi-bindgen`
    - Conformance tests via XCTest against `data.json`
    - `README.md` for the package

3. **CI** (`ci.yml`): Add `swift` job — `swift build` + `swift test` (may require macOS runner)

4. **Release**: Publish via Git tags (SPM resolves from Git repos, no upload registry)

5. **Documentation**: `docs/howto/swift.md` how-to guide, update README with Swift
    install/quickstart

## Implement Kotlin Multiplatform bindings via UniFFI `low` [human]

Add Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) bindings in `packages/kotlin/` using UniFFI-generated code from the
shared `crates/iscc-uniffi/` crate. Published to Maven Central as `io.iscc:iscc-lib-kotlin`.

**Depends on:** Swift bindings (shares the UniFFI scaffolding crate)

**Implementation scope:**

1. **Kotlin package** (`packages/kotlin/`):

    - `build.gradle.kts` — KMP project targeting JVM + iOS + macOS
    - Generated Kotlin bindings via `uniffi-bindgen`
    - Platform-specific native libraries per target
    - Conformance tests via kotlin.test against `data.json`
    - `README.md` for the package

2. **CI** (`ci.yml`): Add `kotlin` job — Gradle build + test

3. **Release** (`release.yml`):

    - Add `maven-kotlin` boolean input to `workflow_dispatch`
    - Publish to Maven Central as `io.iscc:iscc-lib-kotlin`
    - GPG signing + Sonatype credentials (same as Java/JNI)

4. **Version sync**: Add Kotlin project version to sync targets

5. **Documentation**: `docs/howto/kotlin.md` how-to guide, update README with Kotlin
    install/quickstart

## Fix "View as Markdown" (Copy Page) on Zensical docs site `normal` [human]

The "Copy Page" drop-down button on the documentation site (lib.iscc.codes) does not work. Clicking
"View as Markdown" on e.g. https://lib.iscc.codes/howto/ruby/ navigates to
https://lib.iscc.codes/howto/ruby.md which returns a 404. The `iscc/iscc-usearch` repository has a
working implementation of this feature — check how it's solved there and apply the same fix.

## Fix Conan recipe: shared-library contract without actual library `normal` [human]

`packages/cpp/conanfile.py` declares `package_type = "shared-library"` and
`self.cpp_info.libs = ["iscc_ffi"]`, but `package()` only copies headers and LICENSE — it never
packages the native `iscc_ffi` binary or `iscc.h` from the FFI tree. Consumers get a package that
cannot link. Fix by either packaging the pre-built `iscc_ffi` binaries plus
`crates/iscc-ffi/include/iscc.h`, or reclassifying as `header-library` and removing the `libs`
contract. See `packages/cpp/conanfile.py:21` and `packages/cpp/conanfile.py:43`.

## C++ gen_audio_code_v0 rejects empty vector (NULL pointer) `normal` [human]

`gen_audio_code_v0` in `iscc.hpp:472` passes `cv.data()` directly. For an empty vector this can be
NULL, causing the FFI layer to reject it with "cv must not be NULL". The Rust core supports
`gen_audio_code_v0(&[], 64)` and C# correctly returns `ISCC:EIAQAAAAAAAAAAAA` for the empty case.
Fix by using the existing `detail::safe_data(cv)` helper (already used by other functions) and add a
smoke test for the empty-vector case. See `packages/cpp/include/iscc/iscc.hpp:472`.

## vcpkg portfile skips SHA512 verification `low` [human]

`packages/cpp/portfile.cmake:42` uses `SKIP_SHA512` in `vcpkg_download_distfile`, so consumers
download release tarballs without a pinned checksum. This weakens supply-chain integrity and
reproducibility. Fix by computing and storing SHA512 checksums per release and passing them to
`vcpkg_download_distfile`.

## .NET docs still say NuGet publishing is not yet available `normal` [human]

`docs/howto/dotnet.md:21` says "NuGet publishing is not yet available" even though the NuGet publish
pipeline has been added to `release.yml`. Update the documentation to reflect current state.

## Add programming language logos to README and docs `low` [human]

Add logos/icons for the supported programming languages (Rust, Python, etc.) to the README and
documentation pages where appropriate. Visual language indicators help users quickly identify
binding availability and make the project more approachable.
